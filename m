If the muxing is static (like set up once at probe) so that while the system is
running, there is one and one only event mapped to the GIC from
the component below it, then it is hierarchical.

Chaining with cascading is when two or more interrupts fire the
same upper level (say GIC) IRQ. If there is a 1:1 mapping,
it is not chained/cascaded but hierarchical.

I understand you used old irqdomain/chip frameworks in the past,
because everyone was working around the fact that they didn't have
an abstraction for hierarchical IRQs. Using chained interrupts
and custom 1:1 maps and assigning a long list of IRQs like this
patch does was the most common workaround. But we should
step out of that habit now.

Different levels of the IRQ handling having to do different stuff is
what hierarchical irqdomains do best, so it sounds like a good fit.

We handle some stuff at our level of the hierarchy and then fall
up to the next higher level using calls such as
irq_chip_ack_parent(), irq_chip_mask_parent() and friends.

Yours,
