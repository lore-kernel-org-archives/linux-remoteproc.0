Ok, will fix this on v2

Well, what I meant here is that the clocks and resets do not have a DT
representation yet on these SoCs. And when they do have a DT
representation, I would need to add the additional _required_ clocks and
resets properties, hence the marking.

We always have integration aspects around these IPs into different SoCs,
so the compatible is following the SoC name. Also note that the C674x is
just the DSP core - one part of the DSP subsystem.

OK will fix up all these comments as well.
