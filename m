Hi Bjorn,

Thanks for the advice, I'll.

Yes I saw Suman's reply just after my answer.

In general host is filling existing resources defined in firmware 
resource table (using DT information).
Resource table is built according to firmware capabilities. No room with 
current firmware (current status on ST side).

Yes agree, working on this point to differentiate:
- resource we want to modify in firmware resource table,
- resource we want to handle on Linux side,
- resource we want to append is possible to existing resource table

Copy is an issue if not spare bytes are reserved on firmware side.
Moreover firmware should be able to handle new resources on it side.
In general, resource table fits firmware capabilities. If a resource is 
not present, that means firmware won't be able to handle it.
(I'm speaking about basic firmware with limited feature set)

I had long discussion with Lee about firmware resource table extension. 
Indeed we can create some "free" resource slots that host can 
dynamically fill, or a new resource type (like RSV_SPARE) providing 
information about spare bytes which can be used by host to append 
resource table.
Lee should work on a proposal...
