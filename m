This sample demonstrates a kernel-level rpmsg usage, and I would prefer
to maintain the current simplicity, and not add in any userspace
interaction. That perhaps can be done as a different sample. I use this
sample to serve as the basic test for checking the rpmsg transport
functionality with multiple remoteprocs and/or multiple instances per
remoteproc at the same time. The count parameter helps me with both
early Silicon development, as well as exercising increased message
exchanges so that the vring buffers are cycled.

FWIW, this already support multiple instances from the same remoteproc
or different remoteproc.
