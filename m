The _by_name and _by_index API take in a name and index arguments, and
the rproc_get_by_phandle took in a phandle argument, the modified name
in patch 2 retains the by_phandle but without any corresponding
argument. That's what I meant by mismatch.

Hmm, looks like there are all sorts of combinations with some like
<subsys>_of_get_xxx. I did search using get_name and get_index, and
nothing popped up differently. The ones that typical rproc drivers deal
with are clk, reset, irq which follow the latter convention. Given that
the previous API within remoteproc used to be rproc_get,
rproc_get_by_name (these were dropped sometime back) and
rproc_get_by_phandle, I still like of_rproc_get_by_index,
of_rproc_get_by_name, of_rproc_get and then the counter part is the
regular rproc_put().

This patch also needs one correction, the inner loop string check should
be ti,rproc and not ti,rprocs.

Suman
