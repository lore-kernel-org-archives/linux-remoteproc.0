Could this be made into a generic remoteproc producer/consumer binding? Or
are there really things that are specific to the TI PRU that need to be
handled?

Are these supposed to be stand-alone platform devices?

I thought device tree is not supposed to be used for configuration.

Perhaps this should be a "compatible" property instead of "firmware-name"? The
driver that matches the compatible string can then set the firmware names.

Is this supposed to be a pinmux? So maybe we should be using pinmux bindings?

Could this mapping just be cells of the interrupt consumer nodes instead of an
extra property? As I mentioned in a reply to another patch, unless there is a
compelling reason to do otherwise, the channel to host mapping can be required
to be 1:1 as recommended in the TRMs, so that cell can be omitted. Also, since
the interrupt controller is independent of the PRU cores, the cell specifying the
index of the PRU core is not needed in this case. The #interrupt-cells already
includes a cell for the system event number, so this just leaves one cell, the
host channel, to be added to the #interrupt-cells.

So, instead of:

	ti,pru-interrupt-map = <0 16 2 7 >, <1 19 1 3>;

we could have:

	interrupt-parent = <&pruss_intc>;
	interrupts = <16 7>, <19 3>;

There are also already alternate interrupt bindings that allow for the case
where there is more than one interrupt-parent.
