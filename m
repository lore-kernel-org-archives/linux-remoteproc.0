This series splits the virtio rpmsg bus driver into a rpmsg bus and a virtio
backend/wireformat.


As we discussed the Qualcomm SMD implementation a couple of years back people
suggested that I should make it "a rpmsg thingie". With the introduction of the
Qualcomm 8996 platform, we must support a variant of the communication
mechanism that share many of the characteristics of SMD, but are different
enough that it can't be done in a single implementation. As such there is
enough benefit to do the necessary work and being able to make SMD a "rpmsg
thingie".

On-top of this series I have patches to switch the current smd clients over to
rpmsg (and by that drop the existing SMD implementation).

All this allows me to implement the new backend and reuse all existing SMD
drivers with the new mechanism.


Changes from v1:
- Split up the patch moving core code to rpmsg_core into several commits
- Dropped the wrapping struct in rpmsg_core and just added the ops to the
  public API (but hid the implementation details)
- Reordered things to reduce the size of the later patches

Bjorn Andersson (17):
  rpmsg: Enable matching devices with drivers based on DT
  rpmsg: Name rpmsg devices based on channel id
  rpmsg: rpmsg_send() operations takes rpmsg_endpoint
  rpmsg: Make rpmsg_create_ept() take channel_info struct
  rpmsg: Clean up rpmsg device vs channel naming
  rpmsg: Introduce indirection table for rpmsg_device operations
  rpmsg: Move rpmsg_device API to new file
  rpmsg: Indirection table for rpmsg_endpoint operations
  rpmsg: Move endpoint related interface to rpmsg core
  rpmsg: Move helper for finding rpmsg devices to core
  rpmsg: Split off generic tail of create_channel()
  rpmsg: Split rpmsg core and virtio backend
  rpmsg: Hide rpmsg indirection tables
  rpmsg: virtio: Hide vrp pointer from the public API
  rpmsg: Move virtio specifics from public header
  rpmsg: Allow callback to return errors
  rpmsg: Introduce Qualcomm SMD backend
