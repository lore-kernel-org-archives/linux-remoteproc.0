If there are existing use cases that need to be supported
you should list them as non-standard usage in the binding
and not recommended for future use. Rob may have some
comments on how to deal with this.

Then you can have device driver that needs to pass them
parse them from the PRUSS parent node. That does not mean
there needs to be a top level device driver for PRUSS,
the child control module can just parse the non-standard
bindings for compability from the parent node.

And naturally in addition to handling the non-standard
binding we need to have a proper standardized binding
too :)

Tony
