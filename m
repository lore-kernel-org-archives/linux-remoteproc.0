Has the stance changed w.r.t coding up the firmware-name in DT now? My
understanding was that this has to be coded up in the driver from a
previous related discussion on this [1]. I am more than happy to move
the firmware name into DT for all remoteprocs if that is an accepted
solution now.

Well, I am not exactly using the label to number the instance, it is a
possibility outside of using it to encode the firmware name. The
partitioning is really upto the application/SoC s/w system integration
aspects.  Most of the times, you are not running identical software on
these DSPs or other remote processors. For example, you might have one
DSP running an OpenCL stack, another DSP dedicated for audio
post-processing etc.

That said, I do have a need for numbering the instances. This is needed
usually for constructing a destination address to encode the processor
when using a common Inter-Processor Communication API across all
processors (Linux or otherwise). Pre-DT, I have used the platform device
id for this on Linux behaving as the master processor. For DT, my
preferred solution for that is an alias. If an alias is not acceptable,
then I still have to provide an equivalent functionality through a
driver-specific scheme.
