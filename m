I suppose that could work. I will look into it (perhaps after seeing what you
come up with in v2).

Yes.

I guess the way I see this is that it is like specifying the bank and index for
a GPIO. If you only specify the system event number, then it is not clear which
event you mean - it could be one of two events. You have to also specify the
PRUSSEVTSEL value (one could call this the bank or group, I suppose) to fully
describe the system event.

This seems like this would make it easy to end up with a broken interrupts
if you accidentally try to use interrupts from both groups. Instead this
could be implemented in the irqchip driver such that the first interrupt
(system event) requested gets to select the group. If any interrupts from
the other group are requested later, they can just return an error. Any
interrupts in the same group as the first can be requested successfully.
