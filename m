Yeah, I worked on it a bit around -rc4 time, but didn't get a chance to
complete the cleanup & testing before I had to shift to some other
tasks. If you are interested, I can share my branch. I will mostly get
back to this towards the latter half of next week. Anyway, I am
expecting 4.19-rc1 to be in a better shape w.r.t Davinci platform as the
genpd and CCF stuff comes in, and the pm_runtime usage for clocking in
my PRUSS drivers will fit well with those available.

Suman
