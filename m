Does this mapping table take up space in the PRU IRAM or DRAM? If
so, that can be a problem on the AM18xx because it has such limited
resources - every byte counts.

Perhaps one way to simplify the mapping is to take out one of the
two levels of mapping. All of the TRMs say that it is highly
recommended to have a 1:1 mapping from channels to host interrupts.
This part of the mapping could just be hard-coded in this driver.
Then the mapping tables would just effectively mapping PRU system
events to host interrupts.

Perhaps define a macro for -1 so we know what it means?
