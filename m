Can you point me to the downstream code where this is implemented so I
can have a look? Do you expect to get the response on that request?

Do you mean the actual sleep votes can only be with the CPU PM domains
collapsed?

It's been a while since I dug through that code, but there was several
cases where sleep votes would be sent out during normal execution as
well, and then there's the optimization of flushing out all cached sleep
votes when we're on the way down.

Ok, sounds like we have a legit use case for improving this.

The last time I looked at this there where no cases when it was
_required_ to support transmitting requests to the rpm from IRQ context.

iirc we could set up the sleep votes in normal context and the
transition was triggered through SAW(?)

There are two parts of this request;

The first is to be able to send data from irq context. The proposed
patches doesn't affect the implementation of send, so it's just a matter
of changing qcom_smd_send() and make the necessary adjustments in the
rpm driver.

In the event of the tx fifo being full we normally do want to sleep on
there being space, but if we switch to spinlocks you would be able to
issue an rpmsg_trysend() which would bypass this - and you can roll a
busy wait in the caller.



The other part is how to receive responses in this mode. Messages are
pulled off the fifo in IRQ context and delivered to the consumer in IRQ
context. But if you have irqs disabled then this wouldn't be triggered.

So if you need your responses we need to figure something out here. And
part of the ugliness of downstream is the need to drain the fifo just
enough before going to sleep, so that the RPM won't stall on a full
fifo.
