That's right, rpmsg shuffles messages back and forth to some coprocessor
over shared memory, the contexts generating and receiving these messages
are "rpmsg devices".

The problem Srinivas is facing is that one of these rpmsg devices is
trying to allocate and map a larger chunk of memory to be shared with
the coprocessor, which is then going to be referenced in the messages
being passed in rpmsg.

One of the rpmsg implementations is virtio based and have a similar
problem, there dma_alloc*() is called with dev->parent->parent as
device, but this causes issues as dev->parent might not be what the
original author expected it to -- so this needs to be reworked as well.

The rpmsg devices, described as child nodes of rpmsg bus relates to
specific functions in the coprocessor firmware. The fact that the
firmware can be started and stopped dynamically makes the current layout
quite convenient (in comparison to e.g. how we would describe a
mailbox).

We know for these cases that dev->parent->parent is a remoteproc
instance representing the coprocessor that sits on the other side of the
communication channel. So we did investigate if we could just have that
to allocate and map buffers. The problem with this is that these
functions has multiple iommu contexts.
