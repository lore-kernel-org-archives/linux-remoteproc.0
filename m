This seems like an overly complex solution for a rather simple
problem. Instead of passing all sorts of flags, could we just add
a parameter named "page" to da_to_va() that indicates the memory
page of the address in the remote processor?

Or perhaps there is some other use for all of these flags that I
am not aware of?
