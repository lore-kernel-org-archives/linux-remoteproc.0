IMHO it's always better to use the appropriate Linux error code in the
event of a failure and if it's available.  Returning NULL doesn't
actually tell us anything about the failure.  This will also come in
handy when we start playing around with resource tables.  For
instance, NULL will insinuate "no table supplied", which is valid and
execution should continue.  Where as a positive IS_ERR() insinuates
that something went wrong and execution should be cut short and an
error value returned to the caller.

I haven't looked at the code, but +1 in principle.
