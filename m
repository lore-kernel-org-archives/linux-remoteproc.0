Two optimizations in play here.

First, disabling interrupts prevents an immediate wakeup.  When the 
system is entering sleep, IRQs are disabled.  The sleep request to RPM 
will trigger a response, and the IRQ for that response will be queued. 
Once the sleep processing is done, IRQs get enabled, so the pending IRQ 
from RPM will cause an immediate wakeup.  The system will process the 
wakeup, and then go back to sleep (sans request because nothing has 
changed).  This down-up-down processing burns a lot of power.

Second is not waiting for the response.  Linux doesn't really do 
anything with the sleep request response, so we can enter sleep faster 
by not waiting for the response and processing (discarding) it when the 
system wakes up as scheduled.  However, Linux needs to ensure there is 
enough fifo space to hold that response while asleep, otherwise the RPM 
will panic and crash the system.  Therefore, if there are a number of 
outstanding requests that would fill the fifo, then the RPM driver on 
Linux needs to spin and drain requests from the fifo until a minimum 
free space buffer to hold additional expected pending responses is 
established.  This has to occur with IRQs disabled.

If we are just talking about transmitting in atomic context (not 
necessarily related to sleep), if I recall correctly, some bus requests 
are sent to RPM in atomic context, some APR requests to the Audio DSP 
are done in atomic context, and I think IPC Router uses atomic context 
in some cases.  As a generic framework that should support usecases to 
all processors/subsystems, I don't think transmitting in atomic context 
is a special case for RPM/sleep.

Lina et al would probably know better about the usecase details than I 
at this point however.
