In msm-3.18 these still seems to only come from either
msm_rpm_enter_sleep() and the rpm-clock driver, related to flushing
cached sleep state requests.

Right, I presume we save some time by not waiting for these responses as
we want to reach sleep as soon as possible. The answer I got last time
this was discussed was that it was an optimization, not a functional
requirement.


I'm not at all against having the rpm driver cache the state
information and the smd driver process read/writes from the rpm driver
in IRQ context. I do however not know how to trigger the flush in a sane
way.

When I dissected all the users of the API I came to the conclusion that
this requirement (on the SMD driver) came from above mentioned
optimization.

You're correct, the question is still which of these code paths are
actually needed and to motivate the endless maintenance of the extra
code.


Nice to see you on the mailing list again Jeff.
