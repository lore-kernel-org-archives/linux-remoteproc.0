Actually, that's not entirely accurate. This is an internal pinmux (not
controllable per pin, but rather dictates a different sets of groups of
pins at the PRUSS boundary, which are then again multiplexed at the SoC
level using the standard padconf/pinmux. It is a single register per
core into which you can set some values between 0 through 4 IIRC
(unfortunately the values are also not uniform across the various SoCs).
