With the proposed solution you will only be able to have a single subdev
defining the "carveout" segment. I have a similar setup where I have two
disjoint memory regions that I would like to carve out memory from.

Further more, I don't have a resource table in my firmware, so I would
like to be able to register these carveout regions programmatically.

I have memory-regions defined in devicetree representing where my
carveouts should be, so the subdev proposal gives me a way to control
the physical placing of the carveout.


So, based on these "requirements" I had in working a patchset that
allows me to register carveout sections programatically and during the
load of the resource table I can merge carveouts (and the other
resources) to form the complete picture.


But this would imply a 1-to-1 relationship between programmatically
defined carveouts and carveouts from the resource table. Would you be
able to handle this? Or do you depend on being able to have your subdev
define the span and then a set of resources fill this up?

Bjorn
