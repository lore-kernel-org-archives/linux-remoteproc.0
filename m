We're stuck with this problem all over the place, as the world continues
to evolve we will have issues with DT being static. This has been
discussed many times before and the suggested solution is always what
you implemented here - make the code deal with both versions, preferably
by patching.

The fact that you had to export the of_ operations indicates that no-one
has tried this before and I'm happy you did. I'm however not happy about
the size of the chunk of code it takes to do this dance.

I think for this to be practical we need to provide higher level
operations for DT modification - in this case a of_rename_property().

@Rob, any comments on this?

I appreciate your input and we need to settle above discussion
regardless of this case - and by then have it implemented as you have
suggested.
