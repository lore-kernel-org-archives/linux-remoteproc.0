Thanks for the reply Robin.

I see. So it seems that it would be safe to map to an iova without
dealing with iova_domain, as long as the device is attached to a
separately allocated iommu_domain; for those who use DMA API would
need to go through iova management.

Yea, I am aware of DRM drivers that manage both iommu_domain and
iova_domain manually. But it feels a bit heavy for our use case:

We have a downstream driver using DMA API for iommu_dma_alloc().
And it is happy with the API because the same API works for both
IOMMU and non-IOMMU configurations. But it also has one single
allocation that requires (same as remoteproc) to iommu_map to a
hard coded iova. Although it's so far a downstream use case, we
want to seek for a solution that could be closer to the mainline.

The current solution seems to give up the API and add own IOMMU
domain and iova management like DRM drivers. Could there be any
way of reserving an IOVA without giving up the API?

Thank you
