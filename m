Yes, our state machine requires the wkup_m3_ipc driver to control the
boot of the wkup_m3 remoteproc. The wkup_m3 is not a typical remoteproc,
it is our PM master and is responsible for putting the host processor
into suspend and waking it up in system suspend/cpuidle paths.
The remoteproc infrastructure is only used for load/boot, but the Linux
PM state machine and communication is all controlled by the wkup_m3_ipc
driver.

Yeah, I will have to test this, but looking at current code, this should
mostly be ok because of the remoteproc core changes w.r.t resource table
parsing.
