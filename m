I was thinking of using regmap for both control and debug
but regmap_mmio only supports one iomap even though it supports
multiple ranges.

What can we do here?

The control and debug regions even though separate are right
next to each other

reg = <0x34000 0x3000>,
	<0x22000 0x400>,
	<0x22400 0x100>;
reg-names = "iram", "control", "debug";

We could combine control and debug into one iomap and use
2 regmap ranges. But this is really working around the
regmap_mmio limitation of not being able to use more than one ioremaps.

Mark, any suggestions?

Is it meaningful to support __devm_regmap_init_mmio_clk()
with separate iomem regions for the ranges?

cheers,
