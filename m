Might be worth taking a closer look into these at some point.

On the USB case I'm not sure what the reasoning behind the USB vs
USB_COMMON split. In seems that one could just fold them, but that's
another topic. On the MFD side... it follows the select {,mis,ab}use.
With one (the only one?) MFD driver not using/selecting MFD_CORE doing
it's own version of mfd_add_devices... which could be reworked,
possibly.

Ack. Fwiw, I believe that the reasoning put by Jani is perfeclty
reasonable, but it'll be great to hear others as well.
