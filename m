Hi Vinod, Bjorn, Maxime, Patrice,

This patchset adds support for the Flexible Direct Memory Access (FDMA) core
found on STi chipsets from STMicroelectronics. The FDMA is a slim core CPU
with a dedicated firmware. It is a general purpose DMA controller supporting
16 independent channels and data can be moved from memory to memory or between
memory and paced latency critical real time targets.

After some discussion with the DT maintainers I've removed the firmware
name from DT, and now generate the name based on the compatible string.
This is in keeping with how most other kernel drivers request firmware, and avoids
a new DT firmware name or fdma id binding.

I've also dropped the dma xbar support for the moment, as I believe it should be
re-worked based on some of the xbar API's that TI recently added. As requested
I've also split it into smaller patches to help with a faster review.

V3 also included some updates to the ASoC st,sti-asoc-card.txt DT documentation
to make the doc align with the driver code. This is kept as part of this series
for completeness and so any further changes to the ASoC dt nodes in this series
move in lockstep with the documentation. However these is no strict dependency
on this update with the rest of the series. It also includes DT patches for
Maximes/ Patrices STi DT tree to enable ASoC on STiH407/10 based platforms using
the fdma driver.

v4 includes a new slim core rproc driver for loading the slim elf firmware. This
enables us to use the generic rproc elf loading code. This has deliberately not
been implemented as a platform_driver, to avoid having to have double mappings of
I/O memory from two device drivers, and also to ensure that the DT node reflects
the actual hardware rather than Linux subsystems. The slim core is the basis
for various pieces of IP in STi chipsets and the intention is that other drivers
(e.g. demux) can also be migrated over to using the slim rproc for their
elf firmware loading and start/stop control.

v5 includes various updates from Bjorn related to the slim rproc implementation.
It also includes a patch to make rsc_table optional in remoteproc_core and various
other cleanups and review feedback from Vinod to do with the actual fdma
implementation. It also fixes a regression introduced in v4 when all drivers are
built-in spotted by Aranud.

regards,

Peter.
