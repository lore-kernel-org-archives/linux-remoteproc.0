Glad to hear you're onboard with dropping the old property name, even if
it's later.

I don't fancy the idea of leaving the kernel builds with a deprecation
warning for some time and I don't feel the cost of carrying those 2
extra statements is a bigger issue than keeping a deprecated API around.
And it will be less than the dance we have to do in wkup_m3_ipc.

So I think that we should merge these patches and if it can be concluded
that we don't need backwards compatibility with the old DT property we
can drop the inner conditional in the API.
