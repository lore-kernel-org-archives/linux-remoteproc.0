No sure to catch your exact use case, but let me try to explain what we 
have today.
There are different rproc in ST. Some request a large chunk of memory 
for code and data, some have several dedicated memories like IRAM and DRAM.
In that case carevout memories are defined as subdev (like vrings).
Association is done thanks to carevout name in firmware resource table 
(in rproc_handle_carveout).

Moreover, as our coprocessors have no iommu, we add some check on 
allocated buffer to verify it fit with resource table declaration (pa).
This allows to guarantee complete alignment between resources needed by 
firmware and ones allocated by Linux kernel.

Is this approach covering your needs?
