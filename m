Yeah, I did understand your statements after the discussion on the
keystone remoteproc thread, so ok with dropping this. The code already
has the disable_irq() in remove before rproc_free(), so just needs a
comment improvement. I will have to check the other sequences if there
are some missing dependencies, before revising this patch.
