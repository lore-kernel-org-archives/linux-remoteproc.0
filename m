Yes, I have used the PRU with the TI kernel on BeagleBone so I've seen the TI
implementation. My primary interest is in the AM1808, which has a far simpler
PRU than other SoCs. So, I was hoping I could get away with just implementing
the basic stuff that I need and let TI add the more complex stuff later.

For this, I was thinking of suggesting a generic remoteproc provider/consumer
binding that is similar to other subsystems. For example:

Provider node has:

	#remoteproc-cells = <1>;

And consumer has:

	remoteprocs = <&pruss 0>, <&pruss 1>;
	remoteproc-names = "pru0", "pru1";

The consumer device would be responsible for determining the firmware file
and for calling the rproc boot function.

I didn't consider creating a new interrupt controller in device tree, but
that makes sense. I will have to look into it some more.

Can the existing device tree bindings for reserved-memory be used for this?
I would expect the consumer nodes to use this and not the PRUSS provider node.

I have no idea what this stuff is. :-)

(This is what I was referring to when I said I was hoping that someone
else could add more later).
