Ah I thought DRM_VIRTIO_GPU was implementing a virtio bus, bus it seems that it 
uses pci. Which does raise the question of why it is depending on VIRTIO at all
and not VIRTIO_PCI.

Yep OK.

Your right I wasn't saying that :)

My point was that this patch wasn't 'wrong' when referring to the Kconfig
documentation Jani referenced as VIRTIO has no dependencies.

Also I thought DRM_VIRTIO_GPU driver implemented a VIRTIO bus which re-enforced
the view that it should be selecting VIRTIO.

If the shoe doesn't fit, chop off the leg :)

If Bjorn is OK with it, then it is fine with me.

I will update remoteproc Kconfig setup in fdma v10, this will drop the
requirement for this patch in drm subsystem.

I can then send the whitespace cleanup patch separately to DRM ML.

Peter.
