Hi Vinod / Maxime / Bjorn,

This patchset adds support for the Flexible Direct Memory Access (FDMA) core
found on STi chipsets from STMicroelectronics. The FDMA is a slim (xp70) core CPU
with a dedicated firmware. It is a general purpose DMA controller supporting
16 independent channels and data can be moved from memory to memory or between
memory and paced latency critical real time targets.

After some discussion with the DT maintainers I've removed the firmware
name from DT, and now generate the name based on the compatible string.
This is in keeping with how most other kernel drivers request firmware, and avoids
a new DT firmware name or fdma id binding.

I've also dropped the xbar support for the moment, as I believe it should be
re-worked based on some of the xbar API's that TI recently added. As requested
I've also split it into smaller patches to help with a faster review.

V3 also included some updates to the ASoC DT documentation, and extra DT patches
for Maximes STi DT tree to enable ASoC on STi407 based platforms using the fdma
driver.

v4 includes a new xp70 rproc driver for loading the XP70 elf firmware. This
enables us to use the generic rproc elf loading code. This has deliberately not
been implemented as a platform_driver, to avoid having to have double mappings of
I/O memory from two device drivers, and also to ensure that the DT node reflects
the actual hardware rather than Linux subsystems. The xp70 slimcore is the basis
for various pieces of IP in STi chipsets and the intention is that other drivers
(demux, display) can also be migrated over to using the xp70 rproc for their
elf firmware loading and start/stop control.

regards,

Peter.

Changes since v3:
 - Remove elf loading code from fdma driver (Vinod)
 - Remove fdma_ prefix for clock names (Arnd)
 - Make _xlate use dma_get_any_channel rather than request_channel (Arnd)
 - Make a common function for _prep_ routines (Vinod)
 - Make driver depend on COMPILE_TEST (Arnd)
 - Remove unnecessary st_fdma_filter_fn (Arnd)
 - Enable FDMA as a module (Arnd)
 - Drop fdma_ clock prefix (Arnd)
 - Fix description as well as example for st, prefix (Arnd)
 - Remove string concatenation from fdma register macros to ease grep'ability (Arnd)
 - Add a XP70 rproc driver for ELF firmware loading and start/stop control (Peter)
 - Add myself as a author of the driver (Peter)

Changes since v2:
 - Change to dma-controller (Arnd)

 - Add sti-asoc-card DT nodes and pinmux config for uniperif player & reader (Peter)
 - Update sti-asoc-card DT binding documentation (Peter)
 - Enable STi audio drivers in multi_v7_defconfig (Peter)

Changes since v1:
 - split into smaller patches for easier / faster review (Vinod)
 - new fill_hw_mode() with common code (Vinod)
 - new config_reqctrl() called from *_prep() instead of device_config cb (Vinod)
 - fdma-xbar support removed (Peter)
 - rework firmware name mechanism so fwname isn't in DT (Peter / Lee)
 - st_fdma_seg_to_mem can be static (Paul)
 - EXPORT_SYMBOL st_fdma_filter_fn not required (Paul)
 - s/channel/channels (vinod)
 - better describe "Must be <3>" (vinod)
 - sizeof(*ehdr) (vinod)
 - print values on error debug (vinod)
 - empty line (Vinod)
