I was part of a conversation on the list which should explain some of
your queries [0].  The conclusion was, that only the client can know
what which firmware it is compatible with.  This information can not
realistically either live in DT (or any other platform data) or within
RemoteProc.  I hope that link answers your questions.

RemoteProc needs to be offline for the firmware name to be set, this
includes links to RPMsg, so yes, they would have to be unloaded.
