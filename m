Right, I will update the sample code as well.

The rpdev src and dst fields are used to pass information from
rpmsg_create_channel() to the probe() where we create the associated
endpoint. So I believe the rpdev has to carry this information, in some
way.

In this particular case I believe it would be better to use
rpdev->ept->addr, to clarify that we're announcing the primary endpoints
existence.

I don't think we should be too friendly to miss-usage of the API, as
this would likely indicate a bug in the client.

That said, we can make it verbose and remove the panic by adding:

if (WARN_ON(!ept))
	return -EINVAL;

Does that sound okay?

Yeah, I noticed this too, but not until it would be annoying to rebase
my patches ontop the change; so I was planning to fix that ontop, rather
than before this refactoring.

Thanks for your feedback.
