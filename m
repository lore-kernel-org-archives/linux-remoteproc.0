Messages are variable length, so when we hit a unrecognized message we
don't know how far to advance the rx tail, meaning that with this change
we're more likely to get out of sync than to actually find the next
message. Which like would make people debug side effects of this.

I believe a better way to handle this would be to acquire a reference to
the parent struct rproc and call rproc_report_crash() on this, if it
exist (i.e. it's not RPM).
