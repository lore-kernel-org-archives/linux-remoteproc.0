RPM Communication has to supported even when IRQs are disabled. The most
important use of this communication is to set the wake up time for the
CPU subsystem when all the CPUs are powered off. In addition to that,
"sleep" votes that are sent by the application processor subsystem to
allow system to go into deep sleep modes can only be triggered when the
CPU PM domains are power collapsed, drivers do not have a knowledge of
when that happens. This has to be done by a platform code that registers
for CPU PM domain power_off/on callbacks.

Using rpmsg may be nice for RPM SMD communication, but mutexes need to
go away for this driver to be any useful than bare bones active mode
resource requests for QCOM SoCs. By not doing that now, we lock
ourselves out of using this SMD driver in the near future when CPU PM
domains are available in the kernel with an ability to do system low
power modes.

I hope you would make rpmsg work in IRQ disabled contexts first before
porting the SMD driver.

Thanks,
Lina
