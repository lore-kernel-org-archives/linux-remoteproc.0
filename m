Hi,

This version addresses review comments received for v4 of the series.
Mostly cosmetic changes, the most important changes here:

- minor dt binding updates and any driver changes induced by this
- reset handling fixes to avoid asserting/deasserting same reset twice,
  this appeared to still produce some timeouts in some cases; this was
  masked earlier but became visible with one error handling fix

All changes are listed under individual patches.

-Tero
