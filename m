Hi,

This is v2 of the series [1], addressing comments from Bjorn and Rob.
Bindings patch is funnily v2.5, as I posted v2 already and wanted to
keep this somehow in sync. Individual patches contain comments about the
changes, or Reviewed-by tags provided if there are no changes.

I also dropped the conversion patch to SPDX licensing until I can
confirm the license we want to use. Lets just keep the existing in place
until that.

This series still depends on the reset + clock patches posted earlier,
but both of those dependencies are in linux-next now.

-Tero
