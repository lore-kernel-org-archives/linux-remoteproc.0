I commented on this in your v2 series, but let's see if we can
incorporate some of this custom logic within the PRU remoteproc driver
else. The remoteproc core does allow you to use your own implementations
for some firmware related ops.

The resource table is used for publishing back various allocated
resource values to the remote processor, so this needs to be loaded into
memory. For example, with RSC_CARVEOUTs, we fill in the address Linux
kernel allocated. With VDEVs, the virtio config status is shared and
used for synchronization between the Linux host and the remote processor.
