This is a (un)fortunate detail cannot/should not overrule the other

It case it's not clear, let me elaborate:

Yes, using depend might not be the most user-friendly thing to do and
in the long term we might want to move to select.
Yes, I agree with the argument about symbol visibility but that is not
the only contributing factor.

If one wants to pick on specific users which opt for $driver select
$core they must do the same for $driver depends on $core. Check the
number 'in favour" of each case and draw their conclusions ;-)

In particular: both MFD_CORE and USB_COMMON, are _optional_ as only
some drivers depends on them. Thus giving them as an example is
wrong/irrelevant, I'm afraid.

Thanks
Emil
