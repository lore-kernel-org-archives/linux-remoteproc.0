Sorry for the lengthy explanation below, in case you rather want a
TL;DR:

This is not an accel block, it's a general purpose CPU exposing among
other thing audio related services.

Rob, did this answer your questions, do you find this acceptable or do
you have any suggestion to how I should model this?
