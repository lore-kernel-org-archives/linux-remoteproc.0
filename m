No, please retain the kthread. I think you miss the purpose of this wait
for completion originally. Before all the core changes in 4.9, the
resource table is parsed in the first asynchronous loading step, and we
had to wait for that step to complete. Now that there's no table parsing
during the request_firmware_no_wait() for non auto-boot, we can get away
from the need for a synchronzition call.

Yep.
