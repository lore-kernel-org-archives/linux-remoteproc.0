These are interrupt lines coming towards the host processor running
Linux and are directly connected to the ARM GIC. This INTC module is
actually an PRUSS internal interrupt controller that can take in 64 (on
most SoCs) external events/interrupt sources and multiplexing them
through two layers of many-to-one events-to-intr channels &
intr-channels-to-host interrupts. Couple of the host interrupts go to
the PRU cores themselves while the remaining ones come out of the IP to
connect to other GICs in the SoC.

We have implemented this as an irqchip using chained interrupt handlers
with the consumers using the event numbers on the Linux-side. The PRUs
also access some of the associated registers for clearing an event source.
