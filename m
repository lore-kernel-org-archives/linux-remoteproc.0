Hi Jani,

Sorry for the delay, I've been travelling last week.

Thanks for the documentation link. I believe this proves this patch is an
appropriate fix as VIRTIO is a non-visible symbol, and has no dependencies.

In fact the help text for VIRTIO even states this option should be selected
by any driver which implements virtio.

I'm sure they do but in this case it is actually the use of 'depends on'
which has caused the breakage and inconvenience for somebody else and sadly this
inconvienice is still on-going due to this patch not being applied or getting an
acked-by from the appropriate maintainers.

That sounds like it would be a useful addition.

Is it possible to get this patch applied or an acked-by to avoid further delay
to the fdma series?

Peter.
