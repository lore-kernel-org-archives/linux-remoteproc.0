OK will drop this line.

This is used to distinguish the exact DSP instance from others since the
DT node name is a generic "dsp". One of the uses is to be able to
construct a firmware name within the driver using this label.

Will also fix this up based on your comments on the Davinci remoteproc
driver binding.
