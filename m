The TCML and TCMU are internal to your Cortex-M4 subsystem, so I expect
them to be defined within the corresponding node. This looks like the
minimum you would want to start with (given that it seems to be most
used in those examples). Obviously, the others depends on what you want
to support.

Yeah, reserved-memory node (CMA or carveout) in board files is what most
of the rproc drivers have been using so far. OCRAM and DDR usage may
vary from your use-case to use-case. I assume the OCRAM is the on-chip
RAM, so I take it that it will have its own DTS node (mmio-sram), and
reference it using a phandle in your remoteproc node. Usage will depend
on whether you need a fixed location or if you can allocate memory
dynamically.

On TI devices, I have provided it through the driver.
