I do see a similar problem on 8974, if I enable "clock scaling" on the
RPM. My guess here is that while booting the WCNSS firmware it releases
some clock that we have not voted for, which makes the RPM pull the
carpet underneath us.

There are two cases I've seen this:
1) When the WLAN driver starts communicating with the WLAN part of the
firmware before the WCNSS part has informed us about it being fully
booted (and have accepted the NV).

2) When not being patient enough on the first message sent (after
passing #1).


I redesigned the solution to not probe the wifi (and bt) drivers before
we get the indication from the wcnss firmware, I believe that's what
you're running. So #1 should not be causing this.

I have not seen any additional handling for #2 in the downstream driver,
so perhaps we should just bump the timeout and accept that it's going to
take some time for the firmware to get ready. But further archaeological
efforts are needed to conclude this.

The race should be handled regardless.

But the question of who actually triggers the booting of the wifi
system is still an open one. All executing parts of the wcnss and wifi
driver follows the life cycle of the remote services, i.e. follows the
remoteproc life cycle - so they can't request the system to boot.

We could design it so that the life cycle follows module_init/exit of
the wcnss driver, but that's clunky and as we don't have the firmware
available until later during boot this requires us to have these as
modules (or figure out how to get async firmware loading that waits for
the partition to be mounted).


In the downstream kernel we can see a few different solutions:
- The wireless subsystem comes to life when you touch /dev/wlan, and I
  don't think you can shut it down.
- The application DSP has followed a few different models, one being
  tied 1:1 with a kernel module for the specific purpose of booting and
  stopping the core.
- The video coprocessor, follows the life cycle of the v4l driver - so
  that should be fine - except for the firmware not being available at
  probe time, so we're back at loading from a future file system.
- The modem is booted when a certain QMI service is being looked for.


In the Android case we could use the HALs and some reference counting to
keep the other CPUs running, but in a normal Linux system we don't have
something like this.

So this is still an open issue, that we have to spend more time on.

Yeah, I've seen some of that too. As you say it's unrelated, but we
should look into making this not shooting odd error messages at people.

Hmm, 5...

I have not seen that since I figured out how to properly calibrate the
XO before booting the firmware. I'll replicate your setup and will see
if I can trigger this.

This seems "unrelated", I wonder if either we or the remote is trashing
some memory when we're triggering this case.
