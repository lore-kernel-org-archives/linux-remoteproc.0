Sorry that crept in as part of the rebase. Will fix.

OK, I think the best approach is for Vinod to create an immutable
branch with the entire fdma series on, and then both of you merge that branch into
your respective trees.

That way there won't be any conflicts and you can both accept further changes
for v4.9 release. Trying to take half the series via rproc, and half via dma trees won't work
because they have dependencies on each other.

I will send a v11 series in a moment which includes the feedback in this email
and also include the additional fixes which Vinod has applied since the driver
has been in linux-next.

Will fix.
