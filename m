AFAICS after 15 minutes in the docs and code, the rpmsg "bus" is a 
virtual one based around shared-memory mailbox communication, so I don't 
really see how DMA exists in that context - I think maybe that 
abstraction needs looking at.

However, from grepping through the DTs it seems at first glance like the 
non-trivial things under the "qcom,smd" bus mostly map to actual 
platform devices via the "qcom,smd-edge" property - if those platform 
devices are the physical DMA masters, they should be the ones used for 
DMA API operations.

Regardless of the above, would you really need to use this brute force 
hack instead of just fixing the DTs? I'm struggling to find which 
drivers might currently be relying on this :/
