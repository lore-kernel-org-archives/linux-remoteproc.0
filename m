Hmm, I am not sure I understand why we need disable_irq() when we are
not even requesting it? This is deleting code, not adding. The IRQ
request and free are now balanced in the start and stop ops. The only
call here is a platform_get_irq() which doesn't need any cleanup.

Again, this is deleting code, not adding. The remove after this cleanup
will simply be invoking the rproc_del() and rproc_free() call, and
rproc_del() does end up calling the stop since we do use auto-boot where
we free the irq.
