Hi Bjorn,

The following series switches over the current licensing text in
various HwSpinlock drivers to the SPDX licensing format. Please
let me know if you need any changes. If you are ok with the changes,
I will make similar changes to the remoteproc and rpmsg drivers and
post them at the earliest so that they can be picked up for 4.18.

regards
Suman
