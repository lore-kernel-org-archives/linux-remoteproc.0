At best I can make an educated guess based on some downstream debug code
on what regs we do have. But I've already found two of the ranges being
incorrect.

Okay, I will throw in the 3 I know for now, saying those are required.
And then we add the debug regions as optionals after those, based on
which ones we need. Hopefully I haven't missed any required regions...

I'm afraid I feel that is just reimplementing reg-names, for the sake of
not using reg-names.


Thanks for your answer, I'll spin the two bindings and send them about
again.
