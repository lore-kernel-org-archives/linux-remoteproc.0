That's right. Should have added reference to commit
"e9b4f9efff5021 ("remoteproc: Drop wait in __rproc_boot()")"

The asynchronous work request_firmware_work_func() is protected by 
get_device()/put_device() on remoteproc device. So we are probably 
covered for remoteproc device. However, I agree that parent device will 
still be an issue.

I agree too. rproc_boot() calls for non auto_boot case anyway calls 
request_firmware(). So calling __request_firmware asynchronously for non 
auto_boot case seems redundant. I was planning to send a patch to  call 
rproc_add_virtio_devices() for auto_boot case only. I guess I'll need to 
take care of only auto_boot case for the current issue then.
