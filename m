This is how it looks.

[GIC]<---8---[INTC]<---64---[events from peripherals]

The 8 interrupt lines from INTC to the GIC are 1:1 mapped and fixed per SoC.
The muxing between 64 inputs to INTC and its 8 outputs are programmable
and might not necessarily be static per boot/probe as it depends on what firmware
is loaded on the PRU.

A typical PRUSS use case will usually use just one firmware per boot but if required it
can switch at runtime and the muxing might change.
