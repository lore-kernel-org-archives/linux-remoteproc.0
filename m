of_get_rproc_by_phandle() is just a convenience for not having to get by
index 0, as most drivers is only having one rproc.

As far as cleaning up wkup_m3_ipc, patch 2 does that and cleans out the
old implementation and with that wkup_m3_ipc is moved to the new API.


So the only issue is that the wkup_m3_ipc DT binding states that the
property should be named "ti,rproc" and as such someone has to send a
patch to that and make an argument that we don't have to maintain
backwards compatibility. But as this is used in am33xx.dtsi and
am4372.dtsi that might be too late?
