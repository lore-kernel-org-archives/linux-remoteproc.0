The PRUSS SoC bus driver was handling all possible architectures (OMAP,
K2 and K3) which have different clocking and reset integration, and also
catering to the UIO vs remoteproc usecases, by taking care of clocks and
resets. I am ok to replace this layer with the ti-sysc layer on OMAP
SoCs since most of the functionality added to the driver is associated
with OCP, but we would still need a PRUSS driver.

Not all sub-modules are peripherals and managed by respective peripheral
drivers, and we still need a central entity managing the sub-system wide
resources. Layering wise - it is similar if we would have done a device
for the PRUSS local interconnect, but that driver wouldn't have much to
do with interconnect functionality. K2 and K3 families uses TI-SCI and
so you don't have a similar target-module concept that allows you to
query the PRUSS parent node for PRUSS specific ranges or properties.
In anycase, I don't think these drivers should depend on a parent
interconnect driver.

Suman
