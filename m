Following up on those comments only revealed that we have several other
similar race conditions, so I'm hoping that Sarangdhar will continue to
work on fixing those - and in this process get rid of this completion.

Reviewing the wkup_m3 situation again I see that as we have moved the
resource table parsing to the rproc_boot() path there's no longer any
need for the wkup_m3_ipc driver to wait for the remoteproc-core-internal
completion.

If rproc_get_by_phandle() returns non-NULL it is initialized. We still
don't want to call rproc_boot() from wkup_m3_ipc_probe(), so let's keep
the wkup_m3_rproc_boot_thread().

Sarangdhar, could you update the wkup_m3_ipc patch to just drop the
wait_for_completion() call?

Regards,
Bjorn
