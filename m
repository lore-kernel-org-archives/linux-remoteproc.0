That sounds sane to me :)

OK. So just to see if we have a standard solution available already..
It sounds a bit similar to what we're doing with omap-wakeupgen.c
and stacked interrupts? I wonder if something similar might help
here?

Well these are external signals for PRUSS processor (although not
necessarily external signals for the SoC). So why not handle them
with a standard pinctlr binding with #pinctrl-cells?

Sure it may not even be the Linux pinctrl framework running on the
main SoC handling these pins, but after all you're describing
hardware for a processor. Maybe Linus W has some comments on this?
