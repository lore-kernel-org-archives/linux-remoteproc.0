The glink protocol works uses a shared-memory(transport) for
communication between the local and remote processors. The
existing glink-rpm driver implements the basic features
of the protocol and uses msgram as the transport.

The same is extended to support smem based transport as well.
The first few patches consolidates the code, so that the
core protocol code is made common for both the types of
transport.

The next set of patches add the additional features of the
protocol required by clients using smem based transport,
particularly support for intents.

 * What is intents ?
	Intents are nothing but pre-allocated buffers that
	both the local and the remote clients allocate and
	share the details (about the buffer size and an id)
	before intending to receive data. The transmitter then
	searches for an suitable 'intent-id' based on size from
	the list that it was notified previously and sends the data
	targeting that intent buffer, which is then copied by the
	receiver in to the same intent-buffer. So this avoids memory
	allocation stalls on copy based transports.
