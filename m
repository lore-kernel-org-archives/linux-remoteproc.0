OK, then better to name this as simply of_rproc_get(), the _by_phandle()
does not match up with the other two of_get_rproc_xxx API.
Suggest also a rename from of_get_rproc_xxx to of_rproc_get_xxx like in
other subsystems.

I could fix up the wkup_m3_ipc driver using of_update_property() /
of_remove_property(), but looks like these are not exported. I am not
sure if there are any specific reasons as to why these were not
exported. So, for now, we may have to go with the current code.

Tony,
Do you have any issues with us switching to the new properties in
wkup_m3_ipc nodes?
