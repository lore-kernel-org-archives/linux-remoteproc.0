Rob,

I got your Ack on v2, but I would like to make a small amendment before merging
this.


As we discussed related to the WiFi binding I should reference the mmio
registers by a phandle to a DT node specifying the two necessary register
blocks (ccu & dxe).

These two register blocks are part of the riva/pronto (the two major versions)
subsystem, that also contains the "pmu" register block, which is what I access
here.

Further more, the ccu block contains valuable information for debugging
purposes that the implementation of this binding would find useful.


I would therefor like to double this node (in the dts) as both the
riva/pronto-pil and the target for the mmio phandle reference from the WiFi
node.

This works fine, but unless using reg-names for defining the order or the regs
I get a messy ordering dependency between the two bindings. I do not know which
of the other 7-8 register blocks we will add for debugging, but with the below
change I can keep them in block order regardless of the order we implement them
in.

So, can I update the "reg" and add "reg-names" as below to the binding and
depend on reg-names for the ordering of reg? Or should I speculatively add all
ranges I know of to keep the order sane?

Regards,
Bjorn

Changes since v2:
- Modify definition of "reg"
- Add "reg-names"
- Update example
